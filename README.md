## Project Overview

Welcome to our project repository for the course Doing Data Science (040172-1 2023W) at the Univeristy of Vienna. This project revolves around the comprehensive analysis of the World Happiness Report data spanning from 2005 to 2020. Our objective was to uncover meaningful insights and patterns within this rich dataset.

### Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Dive deep into the datasets to understand the underlying structure and trends.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Employ PCA to reduce dimensions and highlight significant features.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Group countries based on similar happiness metrics, providing an intuitive understanding of global happiness dynamics.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate the relationships between different variables contributing to happiness.
- **Predictive Modelling**: Develop a model to predict possible cluster values for countries in the year 2020, leveraging historical data.

### Interactive Visualizations

Our notebooks are enhanced with interactive visualizations, offering an engaging way to explore the data. These visualizations are not just illustrative but also intuitive, aiding in better comprehension of complex analyses.

### Binder Environment

For an enhanced experience, we've set up a Binder environment. This allows you to interact with a results dashboard, play around with the data, and gain hands-on insights without the need for local setup.
